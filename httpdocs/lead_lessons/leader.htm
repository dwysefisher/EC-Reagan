                  <h2 class="align_left">A Liberal Arts Education at Eureka College</h2>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="align_left">Reagan was a true leader at Eureka College. He was involved in any number of clubs - more than involved, he was the kid in the front row committed to the organization. If he was going to join  then he was in 100%. He lettered on the football team for four years, was captain and coach of the swimming team, in  the drama club - in 14 plays, President of the Student Senate, a member of the TKE fraternity, head cheerleader for basketball, and volunteer for numerous organizations. His interests exhibited what the liberal arts and sciences at Eureka are all about - the "mutual development of intellect and character." Remembering that he was a poor kid who never even dreamt of going to college - his achievements are especially remarkable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="align_left">Freshman Year "Strike Speech"</h2>
<p class="align_left">During the late 1920s, as the US  economy began to sour, Eureka College faced some financial challenges and began to make cuts in classes and instructors. Some of these cuts particularly worried seniors who were concerned the College would not be offering the required classes they needed to graduate on time. Students decided to hold a rally/informational session - which has become  known as the "Student Strike" - for students, faculty, staff, administration, and trustees in which concerns could be voiced. Seniors chose young freshmen Reagan to be the student voice at the rally. Howard Short, who had been a senior in the fall of 1928, was once asked why and how a freshmen, let alone Reagan, was chosen for this daunting responsibility. Howard chuckled and noted that "there was just something special about the kid, a look in  his eyes, <span class="italic_left">he believed and he made you believe</span>." Reagan made his speech on the stage on the second floor of the Chapel and students did indeed go on strike for a short time. Arrangements were made and seniors graduated  on time. "Dutch" Reagan, the freshmen,  became a "senior" in status almost immediately and the stamp of approval from  his peers helped encourage the creation of The Great Communicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="align_left">President of the Student Senate</h2>
<p class="align_left">At the beginning of his senior year, in the fall of 1931, Reagan began his term as newly elected President of Student Senate, having been  elected to the Senate for the first time during his junior year. He understood the leadership position he was in but, based on his own freshmen experiences, knew the potential that lay  inside all students. He had been an average student who had committed himself to each activity which he had joined. Now, as Reagan pledged himself to his love Margaret (who had moved on from Eureka College to the University of Illinois), he also dedicated  himself to the College and the organizations he loved with little thought about where life would lead him after graduation. <br />

<h2 class="align_left">&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 class="align_left">Athletics</h2>
<p class="align_left">Eureka College Red Devil athletics were always a core component for Reagan throughout his years in college. </p>
<p class="align_left">He was a member of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>    
    <p class="align_left">he track team his freshmen year,  </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p class="align_left">four year member of the swim team becoming captain and coach his last two years - no doubt a natural choice for him since he kept up his summer lifeguarding in Lowell Park in Dixon </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p class="align_left">head cheerleader for  basketball</p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p class="align_left">Reagan's true love was football - which he lettered in for three years. The coach - literally, the coach of all sports at EC - was Ralph McKinzie. McKinzie was an EC graduate who became the college's legendary coach; remaining on the football sidelines into his 90s and the man whom Reagan addressed as "sir" when McKinzie visited the White House. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="align_left">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="align_left">A Job - A Fraternity - And Make That For Two</h2>
<p class="align_left">Even with the successes of freshmen year, Reagan was worried about the costs of college as the freshmen year job washing dishes in the fraternity would now be passed onto a new student. Yet, during this same time, he was also  heavily recruiting his older brother (three years his senior), Neil, to give up  his job at the cement plant in Dixon  and attend college, join the football team and TKE fraternity at EC. Ronald had joined the brotherhood his  freshman year, washed dishes and lived in the fraternity house (located about four blocks from campus on Burton Street - now a private residence). This group became Reagan's family within the EC family and he formed bonds that stayed with him his entire life. Reagan's uncertainty about returning to EC was sensed by Coach McKinzie who stepped in, assured him that his dedication and commitment to the football team would pay off and also ushered Reagan back into the financial aid office where scholarships were renewed and Reagan found a new  job his sophomore year as a dishwasher for college food service which was located in Lida's Wood Dormitory - the women's dormitory. Later, Reagan often said "It was the best job I ever had." Neil also made the move to Eureka College, took up Ron's old job in the fraternity,  joined the football team and graduated from Eureka in 1933. Ronald even helped pay for Neil's senior year.
